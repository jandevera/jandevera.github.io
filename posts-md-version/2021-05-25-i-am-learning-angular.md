# I am learning Angular

*Date: May 15, 2021*

First of all, I apologize for not posting yesterday. Anyway, here is this week's post.

## Google I/O

Last week was a big week for developers. Well, maybe for Android developer and web developers using Angular. Google I/O is the annual conference that is hosted by Google (duh) promoting their new products, the enhancements of their old products, and their overall vision for the software community.

I'll be honest, I did not join most of their workshops, but I did watch the Angular and Firebase video, which is crazy. I have heard of AngularJS, but I honestly did not know that they rewrote the whole thing. I might try it out, maybe create a CMS for the blog? I don't know.

## After the conference

I was super curious with Angular and Firebase, so I started watching tutorials online. I found [Fireship.io](https://fireship.io) which is super biased with both Angular and Firebase, which is honestly what I need. I watched most of his videos, and the main thing that I got is that the learning curve is steeper than the other famous JS libraries (ReactJS) and frameworks (VueJS).

1. I have to learn Typescript.
2. I have to learn Angular itself.
3. I have to learn Firebase itself.

That's where I realized, I was lazy. I was thinking of using React as my frontend, maybe that will lessen the intensity of the learning curve. All I need to learn is Firebase. As I read and watched recent tutorials of React, I was shook. I have no idea that React had a few updates as well. Might as well use this time to learn something new. Also, one of our projects at work uses Angular. Is it a win? Let's see.

In the next few days, I might document my journey in learning Angular. I hope I don't quit in the middle of the process, or hope that my work won't get in the way of learning. See you next week!
