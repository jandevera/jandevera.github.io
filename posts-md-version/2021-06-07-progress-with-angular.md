# Progress with Angular

Hello everybody! This is just a progress post with my current project, the blog. I have no idea with how to progress since all of these things are new.

One of the things that I appreciate with Angular right now is the ability to create a component with the CLI. There's no need to create it from scratch. Just run the command, boom! The component is ready for use!

I made a mistake while using Angular Material. You HAVE to restart your server so that it loads the theme as well. It took me hours to figure that out. Oh well. At least I get to use it now.

- [x] Setup Angular, Angular Router (for pages), Angular Forms (for the admin), and Angular Http client (for fetching from backend)
- [x] Setup Angular Material and use a theme
- [ ] Create public pages (/, /posts, /posts/{id}). These will have the same layout as this page
- [ ] Use a dummy API to test the frontend side
- [ ] Create admin pages (/admin, /admin/posts/, /admin/posts/{id}). Roughly the same layout with this one
- [ ] Connect admin pages with backend (dependent on my progress on the backend)
- [ ] Create login screen for admin (dependent on my progress on the backend)
