# Basic structure done!

I am happy to say that I have completed the basic structure of the site. I am able to view the posts as a visitor. I also created a restricted section where I can edit, create, or update posts. This is great. All I need to do is to finish the look of the site, and maybe read more about security. 

## Frontend
- [x] Setup Angular, Angular Router (for pages), Angular Forms (for the admin), and Angular Http client (for fetching from backend)
- [x] Setup Angular Material and use a **default** theme
- [x] Create public pages (/, /posts, /posts/{id}). These will have the same layout as this page
- [x] Fetch data from API and display the initial pages
- [x] Create admin pages (/admin, /admin/posts/, /admin/posts/{id}). Roughly the same layout with this one but with forms (installed)
- [x] Connect admin pages with backend (**Complete with CRUD functions**)
- [x] **NEW** Create route guard for admin panel
- [x] Create login screen for admin (dependent on my progress on the backend)
- [ ] **NEW** Update look of the site
- [ ] **NEW** Deploy frontend to public server

## Backend
- [x] Setup schema for posts
- [x] Setup CRUD for posts
- [x] Setup schema for users
- [x] Setup CRUD for users
- [ ] **NEW** Read and apply some safety practices
- [ ] **NEW** Deploy backend to public server
