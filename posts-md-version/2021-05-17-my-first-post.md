# My First Post

*Date: May 17, 2021*

Well, hello there! Welcome to my first post!

## Uh... y u blogging bruh?

The main reason why I created this site is to:
1. Establish my little space on the internet
2. Create logs for my goals using this post page. Maybe the wins and losses I've made may help other people.
3. I want to develop my writing skills. It's not that great.

## Why here at Github?

This allows me to be more flexible with content. I can write some code, or maybe talk about my workouts, or maybe in the future, add more random stuff like some calculators, converters, or games. Also, I have no extra money for hosting and buying a domain, and Github offers them for free.

My game plan is to write a new post every Monday, 9pm PH time. I’ll be talking about random things like my workouts for this month, the project that I'm developing, the book that I'm reading, or an update of where I am with my goals which I might share in the next few posts. 

I’m so excited about this blogging thing. I am not good with words, and I hope I get better as I try to be more active here. See you next week!
